# SQL Server Client Tools

Tools we can use to manage and query SQL Server databases:

### SQL Server Management Studio

SQL Server Management Studio (or SSMS as it's widely referenced) the main utility that is used to manage, configure, administer, basically it's your go to tool for all things SQL Server.  It has references that allow you to launch many of the other related SQL Server tools and also contains a comprehensive graphical environment for querying (DML and DDL) your database.  There are also many built in GUI tools/wizards/reports that allow many administrative tasks to be done using just point and click as opposed to writing complex TSQL commands.

### Azure Data Studio

Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform tool that can be used to manage SQL Server systems for people running Windows, macOS or Linux.  It's mainly used by people who only need to edit/run queries or perform administrative tasks using Powershell or SQLCMD as it does not contain the wide range of GUI tools and wizards that are available in SSMS.

### SQLCMD

The sqlcmd utility is a program that allows you to execute TSQL scripts and script files from the windows command line or from a job step within a SQL Server Agent Job.
