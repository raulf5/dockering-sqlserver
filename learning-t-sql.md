# Learning T-SQL

### Transact-SQL <a href="#transact-sql" id="transact-sql"></a>

Basic SQL statements, such as **SELECT**, **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** are available no matter what relational database system you're working with. Although these SQL statements are part of the ANSI SQL standard, many database management systems also have their own extensions. These extensions provide functionality not covered by the SQL standard, and include areas such as security management and programmability. Microsoft database systems such as SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, and others use a dialect of SQL called Transact-SQL, or _T-SQL_. T-SQL includes language extensions for writing stored procedures and functions, which are application code that is stored in the database, and managing user accounts.
